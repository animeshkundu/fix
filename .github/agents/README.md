# GitHub Agents Configuration

This directory is a placeholder for future GitHub-native agent configurations.

## Purpose

As GitHub expands its AI agent capabilities, configuration files for those agents will be placed here.

## Current Setup

For now, AI agent guidance is provided through:
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - GitHub Copilot
- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude Code
- `AGENTS.md` - General agent instructions
- `docs/agent-instructions/` - Detailed protocols
